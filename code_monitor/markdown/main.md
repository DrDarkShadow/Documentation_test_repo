## Overview

This script provides a command-line interface (CLI) for analyzing and reporting changes at the function and class level within a Git repository. It can analyze all uncommitted changes or only staged changes, making it suitable for use as a pre-commit hook. The tool uses the `RepoAnalyzer` class to perform the core analysis and `click` to build the CLI. The output is color-coded using `colorama` for better readability.

## Functions

### `add_numbers()`

A simple utility function that adds two integers and returns their sum. This function primarily serves as an example or a basic utility within the module.

*   **Parameters:**
    *   `a` (int): The first integer.
    *   `b` (int): The second integer.
*   **Returns:**
    *   `int`: The sum of `a` and `b`.

*   **Usage Example:**
    ```python
    >>> add_numbers(3, 5)
    8
    ```

### `print_analysis()`

Formats and prints the analysis results to the console. It uses colors to distinguish between added, modified, and deleted code elements (functions/classes) and provides a summary of the changes for each file.

*   **Parameters:**
    *   `results` (dict): A dictionary containing the analysis results. The keys are file paths, and the values are dictionaries detailing the changes in that file. Each inner dictionary has the following structure:
        *   `status` (str): The Git status of the file ('A' for added, 'M' for modified, 'D' for deleted).
        *   `added` (list): A list of dictionaries for each added function or class.
        *   `removed` (list): A list of dictionaries for each removed function or class.
        *   `modified` (list): A list of dictionaries for each modified function or class.
*   **Returns:**
    *   `None`. This function prints directly to standard output.

### `analyze()`

The main entry point for the CLI tool. This function is decorated with `click` options to handle command-line arguments. It initializes the `RepoAnalyzer`, triggers the analysis of the Git repository, and then passes the results to `print_analysis` for display.

*   **Parameters (as CLI options):**
    *   `path` (str): The path to the Git repository to be analyzed. Corresponds to the `--path` option. Defaults to the current directory (`.`).
    *   `staged_only` (bool): A flag that, when set, restricts the analysis to only staged files (i.e., changes added to the Git index). Corresponds to the `--staged-only` flag. Defaults to `False`.

*   **Returns:**
    *   `None`.

*   **Usage Example (from the command line):**

    ```bash
    # Analyze all uncommitted changes in the current directory
    python -m code_monitor.main

    # Analyze only staged changes in a specific repository path
    python -m code_monitor.main --path /path/to/your/repo --staged-only
    ```
