## Overview

This module contains a single utility function. Its purpose is to take a value and print it to the standard output.

**Important Note:** The function in this file is named `return`, which is a reserved keyword in Python. As a result, this code is not valid and will raise a `SyntaxError` if you try to run or import it. The function must be renamed to be functional.

## Functions

### `return()`

**Warning:** This function will not execute as written because its name, `return`, is a reserved Python keyword. It must be renamed (e.g., to `print_name`) to avoid a `SyntaxError`.

The function is intended to print the provided `name` argument to the console.

#### Parameters

-   `name` (`any`): The value to be printed to the standard output.

#### Returns

-   `None`: This function does not return any value.

#### Usage Example

The code as written is invalid. The following example demonstrates how the function would be used if it were corrected by renaming it.

```python
# Original, non-working code
# def return(name):
# 	print(name)

# Corrected, working version
def print_name(name):
    print(name)

# Example call to the corrected function
print_name("Hello, World!")

# Expected Output:
# Hello, World!
```
