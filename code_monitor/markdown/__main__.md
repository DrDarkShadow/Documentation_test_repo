## Overview

This file serves as the main entry point for the `code_monitor` package when it is executed as a module (e.g., `python -m code_monitor`). Its primary responsibility is to invoke the main analysis function, `analyze`, from the `.main` submodule.

The script is designed to work with the `click` library, including a mechanism to gracefully handle `SystemExit` exceptions that `click` might raise after displaying help messages or upon normal command completion.

## Functions

### `main()`

This function is the primary entry point for the command-line execution of the `code_monitor` package. It calls the `analyze` function, which contains the core logic for the tool.

The `analyze` function is called with `standalone_mode=False`. This is a convention used by `click` to manage how command-line applications are invoked, especially when dealing with command groups. It tells the underlying `click` application that it's not being run in a standalone mode, which can affect context management.

- **Parameters**: None
- **Returns**: None

## Script Execution

The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block handles the direct execution of the script. It calls the `main()` function within a `try...except` block. This block specifically catches `SystemExit` exceptions, which are commonly raised by `click` after processing commands like `--help` or upon successful completion. The code ensures that only `SystemExit` exceptions with non-zero exit codes (indicating an error) are re-raised, preventing benign exits from producing traceback messages.

### Usage Example

To run the code monitor tool from your terminal, you would execute the package as a module. This command triggers this `__main__.py` script.

```bash
# Execute the code monitor package from the command line
python -m code_monitor [OPTIONS] [PATHS]...
```
