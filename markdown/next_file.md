## Overview

This file, `next_file.py`, does not contain any valid or executable Python code. It appears to be a placeholder or contain incomplete text fragments. The content consists of a line of text with a typo ("chaned in the file") and a string literal ("# Another file"), neither of which form a valid Python program. Consequently, this file serves no functional purpose in a Python application.
